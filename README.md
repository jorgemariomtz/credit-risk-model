# Credit Risk Modeling – Probability of Default Prediction

## 1. Business Objective
Develop a predictive classification model to estimate the probability of loan default (PD) in order to support credit approval decisions and reduce expected financial losses.

## 2. Dataset
The project uses the German Credit Dataset, containing borrower-level financial and demographic variables.

Target variable:
- 1 = Default
- 0 = Non-default

## 3. Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Handling class imbalance
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Random Forest comparison
- Model evaluation using AUC, Recall, Precision and KS statistic

## 4. Business Framing
The objective is to minimize false negatives (approving high-risk borrowers) while maintaining portfolio growth efficiency.

## 5. Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- matplotlib & seaborn
- imbalanced-learn

## 6. Status
Project under development.
